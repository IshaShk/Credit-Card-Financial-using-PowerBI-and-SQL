# Credit-Card-Financial-using-PowerBI-and-SQL

The "Credit-Card-Financial-using-PowerBI-and-SQL" project builds a dashboard using Power BI and SQL to analyze credit card financial data:

1. **Database Setup**: Creates `ccdb` database with tables `cc_detail` (transaction details) and `cust_detail` (customer demographics).

2. **Data Import**: Loads data from CSV files (`credit_card.csv`, `customer.csv`, `cc_add.csv`, `cust_add.csv`) into SQL tables for ongoing analysis.

3. **Dashboard Creation**: Utilizes Power BI to visualize transaction metrics, customer demographics, and financial trends. Interactive features allow filtering by parameters like age, income, and card category.

4. **Insights and Optimization**: Includes SQL optimizations for efficient data handling and error handling for date format issues.

This project facilitates informed decision-making by presenting comprehensive insights into credit card usage and customer behavior through intuitive visualizations and detailed data analysis.
